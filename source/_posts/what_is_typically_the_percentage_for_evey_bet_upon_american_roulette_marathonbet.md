# Understanding the Percentage for Every Bet on American Roulette in Marathonbet


If you are interested in playing American Roulette at Marathonbet, you may be wondering what the percentage is for every bet. It is important to know this information so that you can make informed decisions and maximize your chances of winning.

First, it is important to understand the concept of the house edge in roulette. The house edge is the advantage that the casino has over the player. In American Roulette, the house edge is 5.26%. This means that for every $100 bet, the casino expects to make $5.26 in profit.

Now, let's take a look at the percentage for each bet in American Roulette at Marathonbet:

- Straight up (single number) - 35 to 1 payout, 2.63% chance of winning
- Split (two adjacent numbers) - 17 to 1 payout, 5.26% chance of winning
- Street (three numbers in a row) - 11 to 1 payout, 7.89% chance of winning
- Corner (four numbers in a square) - 8 to 1 payout, 10.53% chance of winning
- Five-number bet (only on 00, 0, 1, 2, 3) - 6 to 1 payout, 13.16% chance of winning
- Line (six numbers in two rows) - 5 to 1 payout, 15.79% chance of winning
- Dozen (12 numbers, 1-12, 13-24, 25-36) - 2 to 1 payout, 31.58% chance of winning
- Column (12 numbers in a column) - 2 to 1 payout, 31.58% chance of winning
- Even/Odd, Red/Black, 1-18/19-36 - 1 to 1 payout, 47.37% chance of winning

As you can see, the percentage for each bet varies greatly, depending on the type of bet you make. The higher the payout, the lower the chance of winning. This is why straight up bets have the highest payout but the lowest chance of winning, while even/odd and red/black bets have the lowest payout but the highest chance of winning.

It is important to keep in mind that these percentages are based on the long-term odds of the game. In the short term, anything can happen, and you may win or lose regardless of the percentage.

In conclusion, understanding the percentage for every bet on American Roulette at Marathonbet can help you make informed decisions and increase your chances of winning. Keep in mind the house edge and the odds for each type of bet, and remember that luck also plays a role in the outcome of the game. Happy spinning!
