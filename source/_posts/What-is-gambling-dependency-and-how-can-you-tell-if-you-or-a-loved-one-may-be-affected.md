Gambling addiction, also known as pathological gambling, is a type of impulse-control disorder. People with this addiction can't resist the urge to gamble, even if they know the consequences could be disastrous. Gambling can have serious consequences for both the gambler and their loved ones.

If you're worried that you or someone you love may have a gambling addiction, keep an eye out for the following signs:

- The person compulsively gambles, regardless of whether they're winning or losing money
- They often take out loans or gamble with money they can't afford to lose in order to continue betting
- They lie about how much money or time they've spent gambling
- They become irritable or angry when questioned about their gambling habits
- Their personal relationships suffer as a result of their addiction
- Gambling becomes the only thing that matters to them, and they neglect other parts of their life

While there is no one definitive way to deal with a gambling addiction, treatment typically involves counselling and behavioural therapy. If you're worried about someone you know, it's important to reach out for help. There are many organisations that can provide support and advice, including Gamblers Anonymous.

#  How does DSM-5 categorize gambling addiction?

The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-5, categorizes gambling addiction as a mental disorder. This classification is based on an individual's impairment in areas such as personal relationships, work or school, and financial status.

Gambling addiction is a progressive disorder that often leads to other mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety. It can also cause physical health problems, such as heart disease. The key symptom of gambling addiction is compulsive gambling, which is the uncontrollable urge to gamble despite negative consequences.

Other symptoms of gambling addiction include lying to cover up gambling activities, stealing money to gamble with, and risking significant amounts of money on one bet. Gambling addiction can also lead to social isolation as the addict withdraws from friends and family members in order to gamble more.

If you or someone you know is struggling with gambling addiction, it's important to seek help from a qualified mental health professional. Treatment for gambling addiction typically involves therapy and behavioral interventions.
