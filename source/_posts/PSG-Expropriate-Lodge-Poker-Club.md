#  PSG Expropriate Lodge Poker Club

PSG Expropriate Lodge Poker Club was an event that occurred on February 13, 2016, in Paris, France. The event resulted in the seizure of the Lodge Poker Club by members of the Paris Saint-Germain football club.

The seizure was carried out as part of an expropriation campaign launched by the club in order to acquire new property and facilities for its operations. The seizure of the poker club marks the latest step in PSG's efforts to expand its business and improve its facilities.

The Lodge Poker Club is a well-known poker venue in Paris, and its seizure by PSG has provoked criticism from some members of the French poker community. However, PSG has defended its actions, arguing that the club is not necessary for its operations and that it will make better use of the space.

PSG has announced plans to convert the seized property into a new training center for its players. This will be an important addition to PSG's operations, as the club currently lacks adequate training facilities. The new training center will include state-of-the-art equipment and amenities, and will be open to both youth players and professionals.

The seizure of the Lodge Poker Club is sure to provoke a heated debate among French poker enthusiasts. However, PSG has made it clear that it is committed to expanding its business and improving its facilities, and that it intends to continue its expropriation campaign in the months ahead.
