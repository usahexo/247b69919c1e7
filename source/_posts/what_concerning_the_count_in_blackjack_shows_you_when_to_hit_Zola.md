# What does the count in blackjack show you when to hit?

Blackjack is a popular card game that has been played for centuries. One of the most important strategies in blackjack is card counting. Card counting is the practice of keeping track of the cards that have been played in order to gain an advantage over the casino. By counting the cards, players can determine when the odds are in their favor and adjust their bets accordingly.

But what does the count in blackjack show you when to hit? In this article, weâ€™ll explore the basics of card counting and how it can help you decide when to hit in blackjack.

## The Basics of Card Counting

Card counting is a strategy that is used to determine when the odds are in your favor in a game of blackjack. The basic idea behind card counting is to keep track of the cards that have been played in order to determine which cards are left in the deck. This information can then be used to determine the probability of the next card being a high card or a low card.

In order to count cards, you need to assign a value to each card that is played. Typically, cards are given a value of +1, -1, or 0. Cards with a value of +1 are considered high cards, while cards with a value of -1 are considered low cards. Cards with a value of 0 are considered neutral and do not affect the count.

As the cards are played, you keep a running count of the cards. When the count is positive, this means that there are more high cards left in the deck. When the count is negative, this means that there are more low cards left in the deck. When the count is zero, this means that there are an equal number of high and low cards left in the deck.

## When to Hit in Blackjack

Now that we understand the basics of card counting, we can explore how it can help us decide when to hit in blackjack. The decision to hit or stand in blackjack is based on the value of your hand and the dealer's up card.

When the count is positive, this means that there are more high cards left in the deck. This increases the probability of the next card being a high card, which can be advantageous for the player. In this situation, it may be wise to hit and try to improve your hand.

When the count is negative, this means that there are more low cards left in the deck. This increases the probability of the next card being a low card, which can be disadvantageous for the player. In this situation, it may be wise to stand and avoid the risk of busting.

It's important to note that card counting is not a foolproof strategy, and it is not allowed in all casinos. Additionally, it takes practice and skill to become proficient at card counting. If you are new to blackjack, it is recommended to focus on learning basic strategy before attempting to count cards.

## Conclusion

Card counting is a powerful tool that can be used to gain an advantage in blackjack. By keeping track of the cards that have been played, players can determine when the odds are in their favor and adjust their bets accordingly. When the count is positive, it may be wise to hit and try to improve your hand. When the count is negative, it may be wise to stand and avoid the risk of busting. However, it is important to note that card counting is not a foolproof strategy and is not allowed in all casinos.
