Henrikh Mkhitaryan stars in new Bingo Blitz ad. The Manchester United winger can be seen strutting his stuff in a black and white polo shirt while playing bingo, much to the surprise of his opponent.

Speaking about the new ad, Bingo Blitz’s marketing director Georgina Stylianou said: “Henrikh Mkhitaryan is an incredibly talented player and we’re really excited to have him on board as the face of our new campaign. This year, we’ve focused on giving players more bang for their buck and we think Henrikh embodies this perfectly – he always goes out there to win.”

Mkhitaryan himself was equally enthusiastic about the ad, adding: “I’m really happy to be working with Bingo Blitz – it’s a great product and I think the ad is really funny. I can’t wait to see how players react when they see it.”

The Armenian international has had a rocky start to life at Manchester United since joining from Borussia Dortmund last summer, but this latest endorsement should help restore some of his reputation.
