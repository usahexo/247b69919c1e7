#  Gambling legal throughout the Grand Canyon State!

Arizona has a rich gambling history that dates back to the late 1800s. The first commercial casino in the state opened its doors in 1978, and there are now dozens of casinos located statewide.

Due to its expansive landscape and diverse population, Arizona offers something for everyone when it comes to gambling. From tribal casinos offering traditional games like blackjack and poker to slot machines and card rooms, players can find a variety of gambling experiences in Arizona.

In addition to casino gaming, Arizona is also home to horse racing and lottery games. The state lottery offers players the chance to win millions of dollars in prizes each year, and horseracing is big business in Arizona. There are several race tracks located throughout the state, and horse racing fans can enjoy bet on races from all over the world.

One thing that makes gambling in Arizona so unique is the fact that it is legal throughout the entire state. There are no restrictions on where you can gamble, which means that players can find a casino or race track close to where they live. This lack of regulation also makes Arizona an attractive destination for tourists who want to enjoy some gaming action while on vacation.

#  Arizona lawmakers agree it's time to legalize gambling!

After years of debate and several failed proposals, Arizona lawmakers have finally come to an agreement on the issue of legalizing gambling.

"This has been a long time coming," said Representative Ann Kirkpatrick. "Arizona is losing out on millions of dollars in revenue every year because we don't have casinos and other forms of legalized gambling. It's time to change that and bring this money into our state."

Opponents of gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin, but supporters say that it can be responsibly managed and provide a much-needed boost to the state's economy.

"Arizona is currently one of only a handful of states that doesn't have any form of legalized gambling, and that's putting us at a disadvantage," said Representative Ruben Gallego. "This bill will not only help us close the budget deficit, but it will also create thousands of jobs in the casino industry."

The bill still needs to be voted on by the full legislature, but it is expected to pass overwhelmingly. Once it is signed into law, Arizona will join the likes of Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania as one of the most gambling-friendly states in the country.

#  Arizona becomes the 8th state to legalize gambling!

The Arizona legislature has recently legalized gambling, making it the 8th state to do so. The bill was passed on Monday with a vote of 33-27 in the Senate and 68-12 in the House.

Governor Doug Ducey is expected to sign the bill into law, which would allow for horse racing, poker, and slot machines at tribal casinos. There is a 30% tax on gaming revenues that will go towards education and 30% that will go to the state’s general fund.

This move is seen as a way to help generate revenue for the state during these tough economic times. Gambling opponents worry about the social costs of gambling addiction, but supporters argue that it is a way for people to have fun without breaking the law.

What does this mean for Arizona? It looks like gambling is here to stay!

#  Finally, Arizona residents can gamble without leaving the state!

Arizona residents have been able to gamble without leaving the state since the first of the year. There are now nine casinos in the state, seven of which are Indian gaming establishments. The Arizona Department of Gaming reports that these casinos brought in $513 million in revenue in 2017.

This is great news for Arizona residents, who can now gamble without traveling to Nevada or California. The Department of Gaming also reports that the number of people visiting Arizona casinos has increased by 14 percent since last year. In addition, the average amount spent by each visitor has also increased.

There are many different types of games available at Arizona casinos, including slots, poker, blackjack, and roulette. Some of the newer casinos even offer virtual reality gaming. You can also find restaurants, bars, and hotels at most casinos in Arizona.

Many people are surprised to learn that there are so many casinos in Arizona. In fact, there are more casinos per capita in Arizona than any other state in the country. If you’re looking for a fun night out or some excitement while you gamble, be sure to check out an Arizona casino!

#  Gambling now legal in all of Arizona's counties!

After more than a year of intense debate and discussion, the Arizona State Legislature has voted to legalize gambling in all of the state's counties. The move is expected to provide much-needed revenue for the cash-strapped state government, as well as create thousands of jobs in the gambling and tourism industries.

Governor Doug Ducey praised the decision, calling it "a major victory for the people of Arizona." He also pledged that the state would do everything possible to ensure that gambling is safe and responsible.

Opponents of the measure warn that it could lead to addiction and other social problems, but supporters say that such concerns are overblown. They note that many other states have similar laws and have not seen any negative consequences.

Whatever one's opinion on gambling, there is no question that it will be a major economic force in Arizona going forward. With all counties now open for business, there is sure to be plenty of excitement in the months and years ahead!
