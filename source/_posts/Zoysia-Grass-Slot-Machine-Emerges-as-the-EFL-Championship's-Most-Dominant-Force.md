#  Can Anyone Stop the Zoysia Grass Slot Machine?

Zoysia grass, also known as 'Empire Zoysia,' is a warm-season turfgrass that is quickly gaining a reputation in the lawn care industry for its drought resistance and thick, lush growth. Homeowners in southern climates are particularly smitten with zoysia due to its ability to withstand high temperatures and periods of limited rainfall.

What's more, zoysia is proving to be a versatile grass option for a wide range of applications. It can be used for both residential and commercial landscapes, as well as sports fields, golf courses, and other recreational areas. In fact, many homeowners are choosing to replace their traditional bluegrass or Bermuda lawns with zoysia because of its superior wear tolerance and low maintenance needs.

The only downside to zoysia so far seems to be its propensity to spread rapidly via underground runners, or stolons. This can cause problems for some homeowners who are not prepared for the aggressive growth rates of this grass. However, for the majority of people who are looking for an easy-to-manage lawn alternative that doesn't require a lot of water or inputs, zoysia is definitely worth consideration.

A 2-0 victory over Iran's Sepahan in the AFC Champions League playoff semifinals Wednesday means Zoysia Grass, a team ranked 117th in the world by governing body FIFA, will now play Japan's Kashima Antlers in next month's final.

The Malaysian club looked far from out of their depth against Sepahan and will be looking to claim Asia's biggest club prize when they take on Kashima Antlers, who have won the competition twice in its current guise.

Zoysia Grass went into the game as heavy underdogs but looked like a side with plenty of pedigree as they took an early lead through Brazilian forward Jefferson Farfan before doubling it midway through the second half through captain Safee Sali.

The win was no more than Zoysia Grass deserved and they now look set to write their name into footballing history by becoming the first ever team from Malaysia to win the AFC Champions League.
