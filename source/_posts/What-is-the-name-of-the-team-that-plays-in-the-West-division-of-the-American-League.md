#  What are the odds of their winning the league this year?

The odds of any team winning the English Premier League are always a topic of intense speculation for football fans around the world. The 2018/19 season is no exception, and the question on everyone's mind is "Who will win the Premier League this year?".

There are a few teams that stand out as the clear favourites to take home the trophy. Manchester City and Liverpool have been dominating the league so far this season, and they both look poised to make a strong run at the title. However, it's still anybody's game, and there are plenty of other teams that could potentially upset the odds and win the league.

Below we will take a closer look at each of the top six contenders for Premier League glory this season, including their odds of winning according to popular betting websites. We will also give our own prediction for who will win the league this year.

#1 Manchester City

Manchester City has been by far the best team in the Premier League so far this season. They currently sit atop the table with an astonishing 18-point lead over second-place Liverpool, and they show no signs of slowing down. Pep Guardiola's men have been absolutely dominant, with 37 goals scored and only 5 conceded in their first 20 matches.

It would be foolish to bet against Manchester City at this point; they are virtually guaranteed to win their second consecutive Premier League title. Their odds of winning according to popular betting websites range from 1/8 to 1/10, depending on which site you consult. While there is always room for an upset, it would take a monumental collapse by Manchester City for them not to take home the Premier League trophy this year.

#2 Liverpool

Liverpool has been in excellent form since hiring JÃ¼rgen Klopp as manager in October 2015. They finished fourth in Klopp's first season in charge, then second place last season behind Manchester City. This season they appear even stronger than before, with only one loss in their first 20 league matches.

Despite their impressive track record under Klopp, Liverpool is still considered underdog to Manchester City when it comes to winning the league this year. Their odds of winning according to most betting sites range from 5/1 to 8/1. However, they do have a good chance of finishing runners-up if they can't quite catch up to Manchester City in the final few months of the season.

#3 Tottenham Hotspur

Tottenham Hotspur has been one of England's top clubs for several years now, consistently finishing in fourth or fifth place in recent seasons. They had a bit of a rough patch from late 2016 through early 2018, but seem to be back on track under new manager Mauricio Pochettino. They currently sit in third place in the Premier League table with 37 points - 3 points behind Liverpool and 9 points behind Manchester City.

Tottenham has some very good players and should not be underestimated; however, they are likely going to fall short when competing against Manchester City and Liverpool for first place. Their odds of winning according to most betting sites range from 12/1 to 16/1, indicating that they are seen as having only a slight chance of taking home the Premier League trophy this year. Still, anything can happen in soccer so don't count them out just yet!

#  How do they compare to last years performance?

Salesforce is one of the leading CRM platforms on the market. It has been around for a few years and has a lot of features that other CRMs do not have. However, does this mean that it is the best CRM for your business?

In this article, we are going to compare Salesforce to two of its main competitors: Dynamics 365 and HubSpot. We will look at how they compare in terms of pricing, features, and user base. We will also give you our thoughts on which platform would be best for your business.

Pricing

All three CRMs offer a wide range of pricing plans, depending on the features you need and the size of your business. Salesforce is the most expensive option, followed by Dynamics 365, with HubSpot being the cheapest.

Features

Salesforce is the most feature-rich CRM out of all three platforms. It has everything from lead management to marketing automation built in. Dynamics 365 is a close second, with HubSpot lagging behind in terms of features.

User Base

Salesforce has the biggest user base out of all three platforms, followed by Dynamics 365 and HubSpot. This means that there is a higher chance of finding someone who can help you use these platforms if you need assistance.
