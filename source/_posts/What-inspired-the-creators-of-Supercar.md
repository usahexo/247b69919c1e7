#  What inspired the creators of Supercar?

Supercar was inspired by the desire to create a car that could operate in the most extreme environments. The team wanted to create a car that was not only incredibly fast and agile but also durable and lightweight.

The result is a car that can not only handle high speeds and tight turns but also climb mountains and cross rivers. Supercar is the perfect car for any adventure.

# How does Supercar compare to other cars?

Supercar is incredibly fast and agile, making it one of the most competitive cars on the market. It can also travel over rough terrain, making it the perfect choice for off-road adventures.

Other cars may be faster or more agile but they are not able to travel over rough terrain like Supercar. Supercar is the perfect choice for anyone who wants a versatile and durable car.

#  How does the game play out?

The game of Cribbage is a two-player game that can be played with a regular deck of 52 cards. The goal of the game is to score 121 points, which can be done by counting up the card values, or by capturing cards during play. The first player to reach 121 points or more is the winner.

To begin the game, each player is dealt six cards, and the remaining cards are placed in the middle of the players face down to form a stock pile. The player who was dealt the highest card starts the game, and players draw one card from the stock pile and discard one at a time until both players have six cards in their hand.

The player who was dealt the highest card begins by playing one of their cards. The next player then plays a card, and if it matches the rank (ace through 10) or suit of the first card, they capture both cards and put them in front of them. If either of the two cards are wildcards, then they instead capture all four cards. If two different suits are played, then it is considered a tie and neither player captures any cards.

The next player then plays another card, and if it matches either of the first two played cards, they capture those two as well. If not, then they play another card and it becomes part of a new sequence. When one player has no more cards left in their hand, they end their turn by playing one final card which is called their "pegging" card. The other player then captures all of the other player's captured cards as well as any exposed (face up) cards from the table to score points.

If at any point during play either player runs out of cards, then they shuffle all of their captured cards back into the stock pile and draw six new cards from it to get back into hand. The game continues until one player reaches 121 points or more and wins accordingly.
