#  Trump Leads in Gambling Sites' Presidential Picks

The early betting odds for the 2016 U.S. Presidential election have been released, and Republican front runner Donald Trump is the favorite.

Gambling sites including Ladbrokes, Paddy Power, and Betfair have Trump as the frontrunner, with odds of 2/1, 3/1, and 6/4, respectively. This is a shift from just a few months ago when Trump was considered an underdog with much longer odds.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is the second choice for most gambling sites, with odds ranging from 9/4 to 5/2.

Bernie Sanders is a distant third choice, with odds of 20/1 to 33/1 at different sites. Other candidates including Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz are all considered long shots with odds of 66/1 or higher.

It's worth noting that these gambling odds are not always accurate predictors of election outcomes. For example, in the 2012 U.S. Presidential election, Mitt Romney was favored by gambling sites but ended up losing to Barack Obama.

However, the current trend does suggest that Trump has a good chance of becoming the next President of the United States.

#  Clinton Still Lagging Behind in Online Betting

#

Online betting markets have been notoriously bad at predicting election outcomes, but they have nonetheless been a popular tool for predicting who will win. As of October 3, 2016, Hillary Clinton was still the underdog in most major online betting markets.

The market on PredictWise gives Clinton only a 27% chance of winning, while the market on InTrade gives her only a 30% chance. The largest market, Betfair, has Clinton's odds at 36%.

These low odds for Clinton reflect the general consensus among political analysts that the race is very close. However, some recent polls have shown Clinton with a lead over Trump.

The fact that Clinton is still lagging behind in online betting markets suggests that there is still some uncertainty about who will win in November.

#  Could a Third Party Candidate Win the Gambling Sites' Vote?

Gambling sites are visited by many people every day, who bet on different games and hope to win big. While there are regulations in place for these sites, there is always potential for something to go wrong. For this reason, many people believe that a third party candidate could win the gambling sites' vote.

There are several reasons why this could be the case. For one, many people who gamble online feel like they don't have a voice. They don't feel like they're being represented by either of the two main political parties, and they're looking for an alternative.

Additionally, online gambling is a global industry. This means that the regulations that are in place vary from country to country. This can make it difficult for sites to stay compliant with all of the different rules and regulations. As a result, many people see online gambling as being synonymous with corruption.

For these reasons, a third party candidate could win the gambling sites' vote. They would be able to represent the interests of gamers and help to ensure that the industry is regulated fairly. Additionally, they would be able to improve transparency and combat corruption within the industry.

#  Rubio Tops Sanders for Second Place in Latest Polls

The latest polls have shown Marco Rubio in the lead for second place, with Bernie Sanders closely behind.

While Donald Trump still remains the frontrunner, these latest polls are a sign that the other candidates are starting to gain some traction.

In particular, Rubio’s popularity has been increasing lately, as he continues to present himself as a viable alternative to Trump.

Sanders, meanwhile, continues to put up a strong fight against Hillary Clinton; but it is still unclear whether he can actually win the nomination.

Overall, it looks like we’re in for an interesting election season!

#  Trump vs. Clinton: Who Is Favored by Gamblers?

When it comes to election betting, Donald Trump is the clear favorite. As of November 3rd, the odds of Trump becoming the next president are at -165, while Clinton’s odds sit at +135. This is in line with most other recent polls, which have also shown Trump with a lead over Clinton.

There are a few reasons for this. For one, many Republican voters are still behind Trump, even after all of his controversial statements and antics. And despite her impressive resume, Clinton has always been unpopular with many voters. She is seen as dishonest and untrustworthy, which has hurt her in the polls.

Trump also has a lot of support from white working class voters, who feel left behind by the economy and abandoned by the political establishment. These voters could be crucial in swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Of course, nothing is set in stone yet. The race could still change in the coming weeks and months. But at this point, it looks like Trump is the favorite to win on November 8th.
