#  Take a Spin on IGT's Latest Slot Device with Platform Chip

IGT has long been known as a key innovator within the gambling house industry, and the provider has introduced its most recent video slot machine desk game, Blazing 7s Supershots, in land-based casinos around the world. The new slot game is based on IGT's established Blazing 7s video slot title, but with a new platform game engine that offers players a more immersive experience.

The Blazing 7s Supershots video slot machine is played on a five-reel, three-row gaming table that features 20 fixed paylines. The game's reels are set against the backdrop of an old-fashioned Las Vegas casino, complete with flashing neon lights and dice symbols. The symbols on the reels include classic fruit machine icons such as cherries, plums, lemons and bells, as well as sevens and BARs.

As with IGT's other popular slot games such as Wheel of Fortune and Star Trek: Against All Odds, Blazing 7s Supershots offers players the chance to win progressive jackpots by landing bonus symbols on the reels. In addition to the regular progressive jackpot, there is also a randomly triggered Supershot bonus that can award players up to 100x their total bet amount.

To play Blazing 7s Supershots, players first need to choose their bet amount by adjusting one or more of the following options: Lines (the number of lines wagered per spin), Coins (the number of coins wagered per line), and Credits (the value of each coin). The minimum bet for this game is €0.01 per spin and the maximum bet is €100 per spin.

Once players have set their bets, they can then commence spinning the reels by hitting the green Spin button. Alternatively, they can use the auto-spin feature to automatically play 10 or 25 consecutive spins at once. To stop auto-spin early, players can hit either the Stop button or the X button in the bottom right corner of the screen.

The Blazing 7s Supershots video slot machine is available now at land-based casinos worldwide.
