International Game Technology PLC (IGT) has announced plans to offer sports betting in the near future. According to a company press release, IGT first plans to offer its sports betting products in the state of Nevada.

"With our proven track record of providing market-leading gaming and interactive solutions, we are well-positioned to capitalize on this growing industry."

#  IGT Dumas plans to offer sports betting in Illinois

IGT Dumas, a division of International Game Technology (NYSE: IGT) plans to offer sports betting in Illinois when the activity becomes legal. The company has already installed its systems in racetracks and casinos in the state and is ready to begin operations as soon as regulations are approved.

"We're excited about the opportunity to offer sports betting through our Illinois facilities," said Lorenzo Niccolini, IGT Dumas president. "This new offering will provide another form of excitement for our players and generate incremental revenues for our operators."

The Gaming Board for Illinois last month unanimously approved rules regulating sports betting in the state, paving the way for IGT Dumas and other vendors to offer their services. The regulations allow for online and mobile betting, as well as on-premises wagering at race tracks and casinos.

"We congratulate IGT Dumas on this important milestone," said board chairman Donald Tracy. "The company's experience in providing gaming products and services will be a valuable addition to the sports betting landscape in Illinois."

Under the regulations, operators must pay a 20% tax on gross gaming revenues from sports betting, with half of that going to support capital improvements at horse racing tracks. The remaining 10% goes to the State Police Gaming Bureau for regulation and enforcement of sports betting activities.

In anticipation of legalization, IGT Dumas has been working with its customers in Illinois to rollout its sports betting solution. This includes providing training on how to use the system and marketing materials that promote the new offering. The company also plans webinars and other events to help educate players about sports betting.

"We're looking forward to bringing our world-class solutions to Illinois players," said Niccolini. "With our experience in delivering engaging gaming experiences, we're confident that we can provide an outstanding sports betting experience that will excite players and generate revenue for our customers."

#  IGT Dumas to offer sports betting in Missouri

IGT Dumas will soon offer sports betting in Missouri, making it the latest US state to allow the practice.

"We are excited to be able to offer our sports betting products in Missouri," said IGT Dumas CEO Steve Freer.

"Our products are designed to provide a great experience for players, and we believe that Missouri casino players will appreciate the quality and variety of our offerings."

IGT Dumas's sports betting product offering includes a wide range of prop bets, futures bets and parlays. The company has also developed a mobile app that will allow players to place bets on the go.

"We're committed to providing our casino partners with the best possible products and services, and we believe that our sports betting offering is one of the strongest in the industry," said Freer.

"We're looking forward to bringing this product to Missouri players and welcoming them into our community."

#  IGT Dumas sports betting to debut in Oklahoma

IGT Dumas is providing a sports betting experience in the form of an app for Oklahoma residents. The app will be available in the App Store and Google Play, and will offer in-game wagering on college and professional sports.

The debut of IGT Dumas follows legalization of sports betting in Oklahoma. The app offers a variety of odds, including against-the-spread, moneyline, and over/under bets. Wagering can be done before or during games, on both mobile devices and computers.

Mark McDaniel, CEO of IGT Dumas, had this to say about the launch: "We're excited to bring our world-class sports betting product to Oklahoma. Our app offers a fantastic user experience, with great odds and a wide range of betting options."

Oklahoma is the first state in which IGT Dumas has launched its sports betting app. The company plans to expand into additional states in the coming months.

#  IGT Dumas to enter sports betting market

The Iowa-based gaming and racing company, IGT Dumas has announced its intention to enter the sports betting market. This follows the US Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling earlier in the year that overturned a federal law which effectively banned sports betting across most of the country.

IGT Dumas operates a number of casinos and racetracks in Iowa, and is now looking to expand its offering by providing sports betting services. The company has not yet released any details on how it plans to enter the market, or what specific sports it will offer bets on.

However, IGT Dumas joins a growing number of companies who are looking to capitalize on the newly-opened market for sports betting. The American Gaming Association (AGA) estimates that around $150 billion is gambled on sport each year, most of which is done illegally. With the repeal of PASPA, that figure is expected to grow rapidly as more states legalize and regulate sports betting.

Several major casinos operators have already announced their intention to enter the market, including MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment Corporation. Both companies have said that they plan to offer bets both at their land-based casinos and online. Other companies such as William Hill USA have also announced plans to expand into the US market.

The race is now on for companies to establish themselves as leaders in the new sports betting market. IGT Dumas will be hoping that its experience in running casinos and racetracks will give it an advantage over its rivals.
