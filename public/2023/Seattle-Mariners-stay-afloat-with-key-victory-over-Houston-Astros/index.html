        <h1 id="Seattle-Mariners-stay-afloat-with-key-victory-over-Houston-Astros"><a href="#Seattle-Mariners-stay-afloat-with-key-victory-over-Houston-Astros" class="headerlink" title="Seattle Mariners stay afloat with key victory over Houston Astros"></a>Seattle Mariners stay afloat with key victory over Houston Astros</h1><p>It wasn’t always pretty, but the Seattle Mariners were able to squeak out a key victory against the Houston Astros on Friday night.</p>
<p>Going into the game, Seattle was just one game ahead of the Athletics for the second wild card spot in the American League, so they couldn’t afford to lose.</p>
<p>And lose they almost did. Houston had a 3-1 lead going into the bottom of the eighth inning.</p>
<p>But then Seattle staged a comeback, scoring four runs in that inning to take the lead. They would hold on for the 5-4 win.</p>
<p>The hero of the game was Edwin Diaz, who got the save and helped extend Seattle’s playoff hopes.</p>
<p>Houston is now just one game ahead of the Mariners in the AL West standings.</p>
<h1 id="Oakland-Athletics-hope-to-remain-in-playoff-contention-with-upcoming-series-against-Texas-Rangers"><a href="#Oakland-Athletics-hope-to-remain-in-playoff-contention-with-upcoming-series-against-Texas-Rangers" class="headerlink" title="Oakland Athletics hope to remain in playoff contention with upcoming series against Texas Rangers"></a>Oakland Athletics hope to remain in playoff contention with upcoming series against Texas Rangers</h1><p>The Oakland Athletics have been one of the most surprising teams in baseball this season, as they currently sit just two games out of a playoff spot. The A’s will look to keep their playoff hopes alive with a series against the Texas Rangers this upcoming weekend.</p>
<p>Oakland has been led by their offense this season, as they rank third in the American League in runs scored. Khris Davis has been the main catalyst for the A’s offense, as he is currently leading the league in home runs. Davis has been helped by a number of other players, including Matt Chapman and Jed Lowrie.</p>
<p>The A’s pitching staff has also been solid this season, as they rank third in the American League in team ERA. Trevor Cahill has been the main standout pitcher for Oakland, as he currently has a 2.78 ERA and ranks third in the American League in strikeouts.</p>
<p>If the Athletics are going to make a run at the playoffs, they will need to continue playing well against teams like the Texas Rangers. The Rangers are currently leading the American League West division with a record of 71-54, so Oakland will need to play their best baseball if they want to overtake them.</p>
<p>This upcoming weekend’s series should be an exciting one, as both teams are fighting for playoff positioning. Be sure to tune in and see who comes out on top!</p>
<h1 id="Los-Angeles-Angels-inch-closer-to-division-lead-with-series-sweep-over-Kansas-City-Royals"><a href="#Los-Angeles-Angels-inch-closer-to-division-lead-with-series-sweep-over-Kansas-City-Royals" class="headerlink" title="Los Angeles Angels inch closer to division lead with series sweep over Kansas City Royals"></a>Los Angeles Angels inch closer to division lead with series sweep over Kansas City Royals</h1><p>The Angels have now taken six of their last seven games and have moved to within two games of the division-leading Houston Astros.</p>
<p>Angels designated hitter Shohei Ohtani got off to a hot start in the first game of the series on Friday night, going 2 for 4 with a home run and three RBIs. He would add another home run the next day, as the Angels cruised to an easy 10-2 victory.</p>
<p>Starting pitcher Tyler Skaggs also had a dominant outing on Saturday, allowing just two hits and one run over six innings of work. The Angels bullpen would take care of the rest, with Cam Bedrosian, José Álvarez, and Justin Anderson pitching three scoreless innings in relief.</p>
<p>The Angels would go on to win Sunday’s game as well, 5-3. Ohtani had another strong performance at the plate, going 3 for 4 with an RBI. Reliever Hansel Robles got the win after pitching two scoreless innings in relief.</p>
<p>The Angels will now head to Minnesota for a three-game series against the Twins.</p>
<h1 id="Arizona-Diamondbacks-resurrect-playoff-hopes-with-series-win-over-San-Diego-Padres"><a href="#Arizona-Diamondbacks-resurrect-playoff-hopes-with-series-win-over-San-Diego-Padres" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Diamondbacks resurrect playoff hopes with series win over San Diego Padres"></a>Arizona Diamondbacks resurrect playoff hopes with series win over San Diego Padres</h1><p>The Arizona Diamondbacks (69-61) have resurrected their playoff hopes with a three-game sweep over the San Diego Padres (54-76).</p>
<p>Despite trailing by 4.5 games in the Wild Card standings as recently as Sept. 1, the D-backs have now won six of their last seven games to pull within 2.5 games of the Colorado Rockies for the second NL Wild Card spot.</p>
<p>Led offensively by Paul Goldschmidt and David Peralta, the Diamondbacks scored 26 runs in the series against the Padres. Goldschmidt hit .357 (8-for-22) with two home runs and six RBI, while Peralta hit .364 (7-for-19) with two homers and four RBI.</p>
<p>In addition to Goldschmidt and Peralta, Zack Greinke pitched well in his return from the disabled list, allowing one run on four hits over 6 1&#x2F;3 innings in Wednesday’s win.</p>
<p> newfound hope in arizona: dbacks take down padres in series sweep</p>
<h1 id="Colorado-Rockies-continue-hot-streak-with-win-against-San-Francisco-Giants"><a href="#Colorado-Rockies-continue-hot-streak-with-win-against-San-Francisco-Giants" class="headerlink" title="Colorado Rockies continue hot streak with win against San Francisco Giants"></a>Colorado Rockies continue hot streak with win against San Francisco Giants</h1><p>The Colorado Rockies continue their hot streak with a 5-2 win against the San Francisco Giants. Nolan Arenado hit his league leading 28th home run of the season in the win, and DJ LeMahieu also had a big game, going 3 for 4 with an RBI. The Rockies have now won 7 of their last 10 games and are just 2.5 games out of first place in the NL West.</p>
<p>The Giants started off well, scoring a run in the top of the first inning on an RBI single by Brandon Crawford. But the Rockies would answer back in the bottom of the inning, as Charlie Blackmon walked and then LeMahieu drove him in with a double. They would take the lead in the third inning on an RBI single by Carlos Gonzalez, and Arenado made it 3-1 with his homer in the fourth inning.</p>
<p>Giants starter Jeff Samardzija would leave the game after giving up those three runs in four innings, but reliever Cory Gearrin couldn’t stop the bleeding, giving up two more runs in ​the fifth inning on a homers by Trevor Story and Arenado. It was more than enough for Colorado starter German Marquez, who went six innings and allowed just two hits while striking out five.</p>
<p>With their win tonight, the Colorado Rockies improve to 53-43 on the season and continue to make a strong case for contention in the NL West. They’ll look to keep things going tomorrow night when they take on Giants ace Madison Bumgarner.</p>
