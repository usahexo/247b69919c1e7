        <h1 id="America-Leads-the-World-in-Gambling-Expenditures"><a href="#America-Leads-the-World-in-Gambling-Expenditures" class="headerlink" title="America Leads the World in Gambling Expenditures"></a>America Leads the World in Gambling Expenditures</h1><p>In the United States, gambling is big business. In fact, America leads the world in gambling expenditures.</p>
<p>In a 2014 report on global gambling trends, the research firm H2 Gambling Capital found that the U.S. accounted for almost half of all global gambling spending that year. The report also predicted that American spending on gambling would continue to grow in 2015 and beyond.</p>
<p>So why is America so hooked on gambling? There are likely many factors at play, but some experts believe that our country’s love of risk and chance has a lot to do with it.</p>
<p>“Americans are innately more comfortable with risk than people in other countries,” explains University of Nevada, Las Vegas professor Earl Grinols, an expert on gambling economics. “Gambling taps into that instinct in a way that other products don’t.”</p>
<p>Indeed, gambling can be a very addictive activity, and for some people it can be hard to resist the lure of betting their hard-earned money on games of chance.</p>
<p>But while Americans may lead the world in gambling expenditures, we’re not necessarily winning when it comes to overall gaming profitability. In fact, according to a 2013 study by the consultancy firm Global Betting and Gaming Consultants, the U.S.’s gaming industry ranks just fourth in the world when it comes to revenue generated.</p>
<p>So despite our high levels of spending, American casinos and racetracks still trail those in places like Macau, Singapore and London when it comes to generating profits.</p>
<h1 id="US-Outspends-Other-Countries-on-Gambling"><a href="#US-Outspends-Other-Countries-on-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="US Outspends Other Countries on Gambling"></a>US Outspends Other Countries on Gambling</h1><p>Americans spend more money gambling than people in any other country in the world. This is according to a report by the University of Las Vegas, which found that the average American adult spends $500 dollars a year on gambling activities. In contrast, the average adult in the next highest spending country, Australia, spends just $125 dollars a year on gambling.</p>
<p>This high rate of spending on gambling can be attributed to a number of factors. For one, there are more casinos in America than any other country in the world. There are also more opportunities to gamble online in America than in any other country. Additionally, Americans are generally less risk-averse than people from other countries, which leads them to gamble more often.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Americans spend more money gambling than people from any other country, the majority of Americans do not actually gamble very often. In fact, only around 10 percent of adults in America gamble regularly. The majority of Americans who gamble do so only occasionally.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time, but it is important to be aware of the risks associated with it. Gambling can be addictive and can lead to financial problems for those who are not careful. It is important to set limits for yourself and to never gamble more than you can afford to lose.</p>
<h1 id="Americans-Gamble-More-than-Others"><a href="#Americans-Gamble-More-than-Others" class="headerlink" title="Americans Gamble More than Others"></a>Americans Gamble More than Others</h1><p>Americans lead the world in gambling, spending more money on games of chance than any other nationality. This is a problem, as gambling can have serious negative consequences for those who become addicted.</p>
<p>Gambling can take many forms, from betting on sports or playing casino games to buying lottery tickets. Whatever the activity, gambling always involves risking something of value in the hope of gaining more.</p>
<p>For some people, gambling can be a fun and harmless way to pass the time. However, for others it can be a dangerous addiction that ruins lives. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, 2-3% of Americans are pathological gamblers, meaning their gambling behavior seriously impacts their lives and relationships. Another 4-6% are considered at-risk gamblers, meaning they are also at risk of developing a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>The dangers of problem gambling are many and include financial stress, relationship problems, job loss, and even suicide. In extreme cases, people caught up in addiction can lose everything they own including their home and even their children.</p>
<p>So why do so many Americans gamble? There are likely a number of factors at play including cultural acceptance of gambling, easy access to gambling venues, and aggressive marketing by the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons, it is clear that America has a problem with gambling. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please get help. The National Council on Problem Gambling provides information on how to find help in your area.</p>
<h1 id="U-S-Tops-Global-List-for-Gambling-Expenditures"><a href="#U-S-Tops-Global-List-for-Gambling-Expenditures" class="headerlink" title="U.S. Tops Global List for Gambling Expenditures"></a>U.S. Tops Global List for Gambling Expenditures</h1><p>Americans spent more money gambling in casinos and on other forms of betting than any other country in the world in 2016, according to a new report from the market research firm Euromonitor International.</p>
<p>Gambling spending in the U.S. reached $116.9 billion last year, accounting for nearly half of the $237.5 billion spent worldwide. The next closest gambling markets were China ($67.3 billion) and Japan ($33.5 billion).</p>
<p>Most of the gambling revenue in the U.S.—$91.5 billion—came from casinos, while bets placed on sports, horse races, and lotteries generated the remaining $25.4 billion.</p>
<p>The growth of gambling in the U.S. has been driven in part by an expansion of legal casino gaming over the past two decades. In addition, online gambling has become increasingly popular, with about one-third of American adults reporting having gambled online in the past year, according to a 2017 study from the Pew Research Center.</p>
<p>Casino operators have taken note of this growing demand and are increasingly targeting domestic and international customers with new resorts and amenities. The Wynn Resorts Ltd., for example, is building a $2 billion casino complex just outside of Boston that is expected to open in 2019. And MGM Resorts International is planning to open a $1.2 billion casino resort in downtown Springfield, Massachusetts later this year.</p>
<p>While Americans love to gamble, they are not always good at it. The average casino gambler loses about 5% of what they wager, according to a study by Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business. This means that if you gamble away $100 at a casino, you can expect to lose an additional $5 on future trips.</p></p>

<h1 id="America-Leads-the-World-in-Gambling"><a href="#America-Leads-the-World-in-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="America Leads the World in Gambling"></a>America Leads the World in Gambling</h1><p>Americans have always been drawn to gambling. And as it turns out, the United States is the best country in the world when it comes to gambling.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for America’s dominance in gambling. First, there is a large amount of available land in the US that is perfect for casino development. In addition, Americans have a greater appetite for risk than people from other countries, and they are also more comfortable with gambling-related activities.</p>
<p> casinos also offer some of the best rewards programs in the world. This combination of high-quality facilities, enticing rewards programs, and a willingness to take risks has helped make America the top gambling destination on the planet.</p>
